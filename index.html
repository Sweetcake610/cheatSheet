                    <b>Hi and welcome to my Front End Developer CheatSheet.</b> 
                    <br>
                    <b>My name is Aisha and I am a Front End Developer.</b> 
                    <br>
                    I originally created this as a basic off-platform project for the course I was taking during my studies to become a developer. I didn't 
                    think much of it at the time and complete the assigned. However, while I have been completing more lesson and doing more projects I realized 
                    that I do take a lot of notes. So much in fact that I have several notebooks at home and binders full of them. You should see how I started off 
                    with compositions books for each language (realizing that was short minded of me lol). Do not get me wrong, they are helpful as I do like to take
                    good notes, but it is coming to the point where they are just everywhere and it is hard to find the information I am looking for quickly. On top of the
                    fact, that I end up google searching what I need anyways. It almost felt like the notes I took were just time wasted. Then the idea popped into my head
                    while I was looking to add projects to my profolio to revisit this assignment and make it into my own online note organizor. This will be an ongoing project
                    and I hope that maybe one day all my note taking would be helpful for another person to use. Thank you.
