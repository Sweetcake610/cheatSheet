                    <b>Hi and welcome to my Front End Developer CheatSheet.</b> 
                    <br>
                    <b>My name is Aisha and I am a Front End Developer.</b> 
                    <br>
                    This project was originally created as a practice project for a course I was taking during my studies to become a developer. 
                    The project was based on using your knowledge of HTML and CSS only to create a CheatSheet for concepts and elements learned so far. 
                    When coming up with ideas for my porfolio I decided to revisit the project and expand on it a little further. One thing that I do very well
                    when learning is taking notes. So much notes in fact that I have several notebooks and binders full. It then clicked, why not make my notes more 
                    accessible to me and not just me but maybe to others who need them. So I added more text, developed more links and styling features to create this website.
                    <br>
                    <b>(SIDE NOTE: This is an ongoing project. Styling and layout are complete but notes for each sections may not be complete.) Thank you.</b>
